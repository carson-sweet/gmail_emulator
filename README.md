# gmail_emulator
A standalone Docker container that emulates the Gmail API for testing (some Gmail API functions not implemented). It uses the Enron email corpus that has been converted into in Gmail format (5000 messages). The entire Enron email corpus is also included, along with a transformer tool to generate Gmail-formatted messages on a per-user basis.
